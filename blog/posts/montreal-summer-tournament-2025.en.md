CAMO 5-4 against Sherbrooke in the semi-final with the last goal a few seconds before the end of the match. Last game against Cornwall for gold (or silver).

In the final, washed out a second time by Cornwall 0-9 but at least it wasn't 0-10! Congratulations Cornwall. Thanks to Phil for the organization and St√©phanie for being the deck ref all day.
